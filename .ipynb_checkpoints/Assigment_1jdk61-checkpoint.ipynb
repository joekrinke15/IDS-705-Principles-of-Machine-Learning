    "**[10 points]** One popular Agile development framework is Scrum (a paradigm recommended for data science projects). It emphasizes the continual evolution of code for projects, becoming progressively better, but starting with a quickly developed minimum viable product. This often means that code written early on is not optimized, and that's a good thing - it's best to get it to work first before optimizing. Imagine that you wrote the following code during a sprint towards getting an end-to-end system working. Vectorize the following code and show the difference in speed between the current implementation and a vectorized version.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function below computes the function $f(x,y) = x^2 - 2 y^2$ and determines whether this quantity is above or below a given threshold, `thresh=0`. This is done for $x,y \\in \\{-4,4\\}$, over a 2,000-by-2,000 grid covering that domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Vectorize this code and demonstrate (as in the last exercise) the speed increase through vectorization and (b) plot the resulting data - both the function $f(x,y)$ and the thresholded output - using [`imshow`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html?highlight=matplotlib%20pyplot%20imshow#matplotlib.pyplot.imshow) from `matplotlib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint: look at the `numpy` [`meshgrid`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.meshgrid.html) documentation*"
