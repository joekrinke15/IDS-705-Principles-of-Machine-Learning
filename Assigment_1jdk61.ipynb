    "**ANSWER**\n",
    "1. We want to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the following matrix:\n",
    "$\\mathbf{A} =  \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n",
    "2 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n",
    "3 & 5 & 6 \n",

    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that for a matrix $A$ with an  eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and eigenvector $v$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ Av = \\lambda v$\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ Av - \\lambda v = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $Iv = v$ we can rewrite the previous equation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ Av - \\lambda v = (A - \\lambda I)v = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take our eigenvector $v$ to be non-zero then it follows that the matrix $(A-\\lambda I)$ must be singular. This means that $det(A-\\lambda I) = 0$. \n",
    "We can solve this characteristic equation in order to determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{A - \\lambda I} =  \\begin{bmatrix}\n",

It emphasizes the continual evolution of code for projects, becoming progressively better, but starting with a quickly developed minimum viable product. This often means that code written early on is not optimized, and that's a good thing - it's best to get it to work first before optimizing. Imagine that you wrote the following code during a sprint towards getting an end-to-end system working. Vectorize the following code and show the difference in speed between the current implementation and a vectorized version.\n",

    "**ANSWER**\n",
    "As a graduate student, I often find myself turning to a cup of coffee for a boost of energy to help me complete my work. As my coffee consumption has increased I have become more aware of the taste and quality of what I am drinking. I now examine Yelp and Google reviews before I select a coffeeshop to study in so I am sure I get the best cup. Unfortunately, however, my palate is not refined enough to identify the specific aspects of a given coffee that make it good or bad. Another related problem is the selection of beans or grounds to brew at home. The main criteria I use to select coffee at the grocery store are only tangentally related to taste- these factors include things like brand name, package design, or price. It would be interesting to understand what characteristics of a cup of coffee combine together to make it delicious, and what package information can be used to identify quality coffee.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address such questions I analyzed a coffee quality database created by the Coffee Quality institute. This data is a compilation of the institute's reviews of 1312 arabica bean varieties and other information related to each bean type. This information includes quality measures (aroma, flavor, aftertaste, etc.) and other data (altitude of growth, moisture content, processing method). Each observation is a single review of a coffee type. It is important to note that each review is not necessarily conducted by the same reviewer. However, all reviews were scored using the Coffee Quality Institute's standardized method called the Q grader. I ultimately decided to examine three different factors that may be related to coffee quality. The first factor is altitude of growth- many believe that the reduced growing speed caused by lower oxygen levels leads to more complex flavors. "
